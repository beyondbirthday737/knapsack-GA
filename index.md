<h2>What is Genetic algorithms ?</h2>

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

<h2>Knapsack problem</h2>

The backpack problem Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem . The name is given due to the model of a situation in which it is necessary to fill a backpack with objects of different weights and values. The goal is to fill the backpack with the highest possible value, not exceeding the maximum weight.

<h2>Solving the Knapsack problem</h2>

<h3>First Population</h3>

First step is creating an initial population. N backpacks will be filled with random items until the weight limit is reached.

```python
import random
from extract_objects import Objects
import csv
import os


class Knapsack:
    def __init__(self, total_individual, total_chromosomes, total_generations, mutation_rate, crossover_rate, elite,  pack_weigth_limit, objects):
        self.total_individual = total_individual
        self.total_chromosomes = total_chromosomes
        self.total_generations = total_generations
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.crossover_rate = crossover_rate
        self.elite = elite
        self.pack_weigth_limit = pack_weigth_limit
        self.objects = objects.get_objects_list()
        
        self.population = None
        self.fitness_list = []
        self.weight_list = []
        self.individual_dic = []


    def first_population(self):
        """this function create a random population"""
        self.population = [[0 for i in range(self.total_chromosomes)] for i in range(self.total_individual)]

        for individual in range(self.total_individual):
            for chromosome in range(self.total_chromosomes):
                self.population[individual][chromosome] = random.randint(0, 1)
            
        return self
```

<h3>Calculate Fitness</h3>

In this step we will implement the function to calculate the fitness score

```python
def calc_fitness(self, individual):
    """calculate individual fitness"""
    sum_weight = 0
    fitness = 0
    index = 1
        
    for gen in individual:
        if gen == 1:
            sum_weight += int(self.objects[index].split(';')[1])
            fitness += int(self.objects[index].split(';')[2])
        index += 1

    self.weight_list.append(sum_weight)
    self.fitness_list.append(fitness)
    return fitness, sum_weight

```

<h3>Tournament Selection</h3>

Tournament selection is a method of selecting an individual from a population of individuals in a genetic algorithm. Tournament selection involves running several "tournaments" among a few individuals chosen at random from the population. The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover

```python        
def tournament_selection(self, index_individual1, index_individual2):
    """This function select the best individual"""
    if(abs(self.fitness_list[index_individual1]) > abs(self.fitness_list[index_individual2])):
        winner_index = index_individual1
    else:
        winner_index = index_individual2
        
    return winner_index

```
