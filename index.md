### Knapsack problem

The backpack problem Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem . The name is given due to the model of a situation in which it is necessary to fill a backpack with objects of different weights and values. The goal is to fill the backpack with the highest possible value, not exceeding the maximum weight.
