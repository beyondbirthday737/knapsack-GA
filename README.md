<h2>What is Genetic algorithms ?</h2>

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

<h2>Knapsack problem</h2>

The Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem . The name is given due to the model of a situation in which it is necessary to fill a backpack with objects of different weights and values. The goal is to fill the backpack with the highest possible value, not exceeding the maximum weight.
